0.  BMP:  4,294,967,296 colors (up to 32-bits per pixel)
    GIF:  256 colors (up to 8-bits per pixel indexed from 24-bit RGB color space)
    JPEG: 16,777,216 colors (24-bits per pixel)
    PNG:  281,474,976,710,656 colors (48-bit truecolor)
        
1.  GIF
    
2.  Lossy compression compresses a file destructively, eliminating unnecessary
    pixel information over large chunks. Lossless compression compresses chunks
    of equal pixels, but does not destroy any original pixel information.
    
3.  JPEG
 
4.  When a file is "deleted" on a FAT file system, the filename is changed to 
    indicate the file's space in the directory can be recycled, then the space
    allocated to the file is moved to the hard drive's list of free space. 
    
5.  Either use an operating system that utilizes an encrypted file scheme wherein
    you can simply erase the encryption key, or overwrite all of the readable
    space with 0's or another acceptable pattern.
    
6.  stdint.h defines a stricter set of fixed-width integers necessary to enhance 
    the portability of programs, especially in environments where only certain
    types of integers are supported by the hardware.

7.  They all define the exact width, in bits, of a block of data.
    
8.  BYTE  = 1 byte  (8-bits, unsigned)
    DWORD = 4 bytes (32-bits unsigned)
    LONG  = 4 bytes (32-bits signed)
    WORD  = 2 bytes (16-bits unsigned)
    
9.  0x4d42 (or, 'MB')

10. bfSize is the total size, in bytes, of the bitmap file, whereas the biSize 
    is the size, in bytes, of the BITMAPINFOHEADER.

11. If biHeight is negative, then the bitmap is a top-down DIB; its origin is the
    upper-left corner (as it should be in a sane world).
   
12. biBitCount specifies the BMP's color depth (i.e., bits per pixel).
    
13. fopen might return NULL in copy.c:37 because the user doesn't have permission
    to write to the current place in memory, or the file could exceed the amount
    of memory available.

14. 1 refers to the number of times we want to read a block of a specified size.
    Since the sizes we have specified are specific to the file type (the bitmap 
    header types and the RGBTRIPPLE), we only want to read that specific size 
    once per call to the fread function.

15. If bi.biWidth is 3, padding is 3 bytes (one RGBTRIPPLE).

16. fseek moves the file pointer to a specific point in a file being read. In this
    case, it's used to skip ahead in the inptr file a distance equal to the size
    of the padding from the current position held by the pointer (see next question).
    
17. SEEK_CUR is a constant referring to the current pointer's position in a file.

18. Whodunit? Rob Bowden. You should be ashamed.
